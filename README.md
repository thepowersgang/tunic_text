# tunic_text
A quick tool to decode the text from the adventure game "Tunic"

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS SPOILERS!

Only look at the tool if you have page 54 of the in-game manual, otherwise you'll be mega-spoiled

Rendered: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/thepowersgang/tunic_text/blob/master/tunic_text.html

## Using
There's instructions on the page itself.

- `tunic_text_bare.html` is a version with no meaning ascribed to any symbol - download this and edit to assign meanings to each symbol.
- `tunic_text.html` is filled in already, suitable for attempting translation of text.

## Technical details
Liberal use of HTML canvas, with a custom hacky text editor interface :)
